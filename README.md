## Why is Installomator.sh here?
This is a variation of Installomator based on version 10.9, that doesn't contain the label's, and uses the GitHub API, enabling the use of a Github API key, to handle accessing/downloading installers and version information from Github. But not including the labels the script is a mere 2000~ lines, instead of the 11000+ lines with all the labels attached, and instead grabs the labels directly from Installomator's Github labels folder. While this does mean requiring a match to the label's filename (some labels can be referenced multiple ways). This version can also read from a file in /usr/local/Installomator/labels and expects it to be formatted as a standard Installomator label (as a means of overriding what might be online), allowing for a more robust way of doing valuesfromarguments where the code might be more complex.
